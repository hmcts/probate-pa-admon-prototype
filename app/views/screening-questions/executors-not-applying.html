<p>If an executor has chosen not to apply now or in the future, this is known as 'renouncing'. You'll need to give more information about renouncing executors as part of your application.</p> 

<p>If there is another reason that an executor canâ€™t apply, for example they are not capable of making their own decisions, you need to <a href="">continue your application on paper </a>. </p>
